# Archive Explorer Project Documentation

## App Idea Overview

### Description
Archive Explorer is a web application designed to leverage the Wayback Machine's API to help users discover archived versions of web pages. It's a tool aimed at researchers, historians, and the general public who wish to explore the historical snapshots of websites. Whether you're investigating the evolution of a particular site or trying to retrieve lost content, Archive Explorer provides an easy-to-use interface to navigate through time. The application simplifies the process of checking if a given URL is archived and displays the closest snapshot available.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The MVP of Archive Explorer consists of:
- A homepage where users can input a URL to check its archive status.
- A results page displaying the closest archived snapshot if available, including timestamp, status, and a direct link to the archived page.
- An about page providing information on how to use the application and its purpose.

## User Stories

### Landing Page
- As a user, I want to enter a URL into an input field so that I can check if it has been archived.
- As a user, I want to submit the URL easily to see the results of the archive check.

### Results Page
- As a user, I expect to see whether the URL I submitted is archived.
- As a user, if the URL is archived, I want to see the closest snapshot's details, including a link to view it on the Wayback Machine.

### About Page
- As a user, I want to learn more about the Archive Explorer, its purpose, and how to use it effectively.

### Optional Features
- Users can specify a date range for the archive search.
- Users can view a list of all available snapshots for a given URL.

## Wireframe

### HomePage
- Layout: A simple input field centered on the page with a "Check Archive" button.
- Color Scheme: Modern and minimalistic, using shades of blue and gray to promote a tech-savvy look.

### Results Page
- Layout: Display results in a card-like format, showing the snapshot's timestamp, status, and a clickable link to the archive.
- Color Scheme: Consistent with the HomePage, using a comforting green for successful archive retrieval notifications.

### About Page
- Layout: A clean layout providing text information about the application.
- Color Scheme: Soft shades of the primary palette to ensure readability.

*Note: For the actual wireframes, you can use tools like wireframe.cc to create simple and clear visuals of each page.*
