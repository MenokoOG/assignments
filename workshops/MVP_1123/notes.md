## **Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and CSS**

**What is an MVP project and what does it look like?**

- An MVP is a product or service that has the minimum features required to be viable.
- In VSchool, it is important to stick to MVP because it helps us stay focused and avoid wasting time on features that users may not need or want.

**Why is it important to stick to MVP in VSchool?**
