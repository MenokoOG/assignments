**Notes for Power Point:** 

### 

- **What is React Router DOM?**
    - A library for managing navigation in React applications
    - Enables the creation of single-page applications with dynamic content
    - Provides a clean separation of concerns for routing and component logic

- **Benefits of using React Router DOM:**
    - Improved user experience with smooth transitions between pages
    - Better SEO by managing URL structure
    - Easier application maintenance and code organization
    - Enhanced accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies

### **Basic Routing Syntax**

- **Routes:**
    - Represent different sections of your application
    - Defined using JSX or a dedicated `Route` component
    - Specify a path and a component to render for that path
- **Navigation:**
    - Use the `Link` component to navigate between routes
    - Provides declarative navigation with accessible URLs
    - Can be styled and customized to match your design
- **Parameters:**
    - Pass data between routes using URL parameters
    - Accessed within the component using `useParams` hook
- **Nested Routing:**
    - Organize your application with hierarchical route structures
    - Nest routes within parent routes for related content
