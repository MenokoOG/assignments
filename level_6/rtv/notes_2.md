You are going to create a full stack application with user authentication created with Node, React, Express, Mongoose & Mongodb that allows users to post and upvote or downvote political issues.

This assignment has the most difficult requirements of any at V School. Ask around and find or make a friend who is working on it.

# **Requirements:**

- A login/signup page that is required to visit any part of the application.
- Web page that shows a list of political issues.
    - Each item will have a title
    - Each item will have a description
    - Each item can be upvoted or downvoted.
        - User's should only be able to upvote/downvote once per issue.
    - Items will be ordered by upvotes (the most being at the top).
    - Each item should show the total number of votes
- Include a page that will allow logged in users to add new posts.
- Include a page that will allow logged in users to view all posts they personally made.
- Users can comment on posts (unlimited number of comments per post)
- You will create a back end with the needed 'models' and 'routes' so that all topics, comments, and votes are persistent.
- Use React for the front-end
- Use Node/Express for the back-end
- Use MongoDB and Mongoose for your database and models
- Use dotenv, jsonwebtoken & expressJwt to manage user authentication.

Clearly you will need the ability to `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

You will want to approach this project in 3 parts while following the Level 6 vidoes and associated git repository. After implementing the user authentication code with the videos using the git repository provided, replicate that code again for this project.

After Part 3 of the video series you should have user authentication and basic routing set up so that you can continue to develop the rest of this application.
