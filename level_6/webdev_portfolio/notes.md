## Creating a Web Developer Portfolio

Your portfolio will be a dedicated website that highlights and demonstrates your strengths and abilities as a web developer.

For this assignment, you can use any web development technologies you'd like. And, not to worry, you won't have to code your portfolio from scratch! In fact, that's not a good use of your valuable time.

**Start *very* basic**. Resist the temptation to add a lot of bells and whistles right up front. Just because you *can* doesn't mean you *should*. **CLEAR over cute or clever** will always win the day so keep it simple. Hiring managers simply need to be able to glean basic information about you and see your skills in action quickly and easily. **Make the path to hiring you as simple and clean as possible**.

Creating a **minimal**, **well-designed website** that contains your **primary** important information ****is more than sufficient in order to pass this assignment and get hired. Don’t forget that you can always fine-tune it once you’re in Stage 2 as well.

# Basic **Dos and Don'ts of a Portfolio**

### **Do:**

- Use a nice font that is subtle and classy. Something like [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) from Google Fonts
- Take the edge off the stark white background by changing the color to something subtle and neutral, like a very *very* light gray (See the "whitesmoke" CSS color for an example)
- Take the edge off the sharp black text by lightening it a bit, like a very *very* dark gray.
- Use very subtle transitions if you decide to include them. Nothing should be jarring or move a whole lot on the page
- Stick to one or two fonts at most
- List the languages and technologies you've used (JavaScript, React, Redux, Git, JSON Web Tokens, Express, MongoDB, Node.js, HTML Canvas, etc.)

### **Don't:**

- Use a silly, childish, busy, or unprofessional font.
- Use sharp or heavily contrasted colors.
- Use multiple font families in the same type of text. (Different fonts for different paragraphs, i.e.)
    - At most, have one font family for headers and another for paragraph text
- Put long paragraphs. No one will read them.
- Tell your story of being a total beginner programmer or your journey that led you to want to code.
- Put a chart indicating your level of proficiency in a given language or technology (80% in CSS, 85% in JavaScript, etc.).
- List the editor or IDE you use.

# **Portfolio Resources**

Your main focus is going to be showcasing your skills through your body of work so you can get an amazing job so using a framework or pre-made template is just great! Here are a few resources that will help you **get a head-start** on your portfolio website and **speed up development time**.

### **Free Responsive HTML5 Templates**

It's perfectly fine to use a pre-made template as a basis for your portfolio. [HTML5up.net](http://html5up.net/) offers many beautiful, modern & fully responsive websites that are free for you to use and customize.

### **CSS Frameworks for Layouts & Styling:**

Laying out your elements and making them sit correctly on any screen size can be especially frustrating and time-consuming. Consider using a simple, responsive framework that takes care of that for you.

1. **[Bulma.io](http://bulma.io/)** is a CSS library that only consists of classes, so none of your HTML is impacted by it. You'll have to use the classes in the library to apply any of the styling, which makes it easy to take only what you want from the library, and customize the rest.
2. **[Tailwindcss.com](http://tailwindcss.com/)** is another CSS framework with pre-defined classes.
3. **[Purecss.io](http://purecss.io/)** also allows you to choose the parts that you want, such as the grid framework without importing everything.
4. If you want just a responsive grid framework, try **[Simplegrid.io](http://simplegrid.io/)**

### **Good Examples:**

- https://xandroxygen.github.io/ (Except for the charts at the bottom)
- [20 Memorable Web Design Portfolios](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/web-design-portfolio-inspiration)

### **Passing Criteria: Visual inspection and pass off.**

An outcomes team member will go over your portfolio and evaluate your portfolio based on the technical recruiter requirements.
