Code Problem Solving Process.
1. Understand Problem
2. Plan Code-psuedocode
3. Execute code
4. Review

1) Read Problem-
	a. Look for Action Statement:
		- variable & data (sets and gets)
		- functions (input & output)
		- logic & conditionals (if, then, else then etc...)
		- loops (interations)
		- error handling (edge cases)
	b. Simplify-
		- focus in on what they are asking
		- look for hwo it all ties together
		- understand the action statements and expected output
		- who, what, when, where, whay, and how.
	c. 3 questions-
		- did i understand the problem fully?
		- do ihave enough information to solve?
		- would i be able to explain this to someone else?
	d. make adjustments-
		- ask clarifying questions
		- repeat process if needed
		- google is freind
		- use mentors other developers for assistance
2) Plan Code-
	a. psuedo code:

	action statements:                       rules:
	-varaibles                       - no useless statements
	- functions                     - proper indentation
	- logic                         - properly name conventions
	- loops                         - single purpose functions
	- error handling                - syntax is preferred
	- comments                      - case sensitive

3) Code- 
	a. sturcture: variables, functions, loops
		- verify as code being built, console logs

	b. logic: logic, error handling, conditionals, comments
		- verify

4) Review-
	a. requirements- base case, edge case , give examples of use when needed, unit test files etc....

	b. is it readable, repeat process and runtime stats or issues

	c. opimize 

	d. consider resources to use
