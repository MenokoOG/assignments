# Code Problem Solving Process.
## 1. Understand Problem
## 2. Plan Code-psuedocode
## 3. Execute code
## 4. Review

## 1. Read and Understand Problem
 ###  Look for Action Statements
* variable & data (sets and gets)
*  functions (input & output)
*  logic & conditionals (if, then, else then etc...)
* loops (interations)
*  error handling (edge cases)
### Simplify
* focus in on what they are asking
* look for hwo it all ties together
*  understand the action statements and expected output
*  who, what, when, where, whay, and how.
### Ask Three questions-
* did i understand the problem fully?
*  do i have enough information to solve?
*  would i be able to explain this to someone else?
### Make adjustments
* ask clarifying questions
* repeat process if needed
* google is freind
* use mentors other developers for assistance
## 2.  Plan Code
### Pseudo code

| Action Statements | Rules |
| :---: | :---: |
|varaibles | no useless statements |
|functions | proper indentation|
|logic | properly name conventions|
| loops| single purpose functions|
| error handling| syntax is preferred|
| comments| case sensitive |


## 3. Code- 
 ### Structure  
* variables
* functions
* loops
*  verify as code being built, console logs
### Logic  
* error handling 
* conditionals, 
* comments
### Verify

## 4. Review
### Requirements- 
* base case 
* edge case  
* give examples of use when needed 
* unit test files etc....

### Is it readable? 
### Optimize
* repeat process and runtime stats or issue


### Consider resources to use
