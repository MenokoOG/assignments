. Problem: Create a react-vite form website. 

 1. Html Document Form Structure:
 Input Fields:
First Name- text input
Last Name- text input
Email - text input
Place of Birth - text input
Phone - text input numbers as string
Favorite Food -text input
Comment Box- text area input
Submit Button - react submit button 

2. Functionality:
a. The user should be able to enter their information in the badge fields

b. Upon submit, the badge fields should be cleared, and a new badge should be displayed below the badge form

c. Each time the user submits a badge, each badge will be printed below the form in a list

d. Specify input types to correspond with the required information

e. Add a minimal character count of 3 for each field

f. The new badge should not appear until after it is submitted

g. Make the color of the badge heading background alternate on each list item ie... Red, Blue, Red, Blue - dynamic rendering

tips:
-Store all badges in an array in state

- Display each badge by mapping through the badges array
