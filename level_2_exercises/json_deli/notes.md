You're opening a new sandwich shop in Silicon Valley called JSON's Deli which is geared specifically towards programmers. You need to come up with a menu to display all of your items, and you decided you want to write it up in JSON format to delight your customer base.

- The JSON should be saved as a JSON file (`menu.json`) and should be an **object** (`{}`) representing the entirety of your menu.
- Your menu JSON should consist of multiple properties, each one an array, represent the array of options available for:
    - appetizers
    - cold sandwiches
    - hot sandwiches
    - desserts
    - drinks
- Each item in each array should be an object consisting of 3 properties:
    - name of the item/sandwich
    - an array of strings representing the ingredients
    - a string description.
- You must have at least 2 items (objects) on each submenu (appetizers, cold sands, hot sands, desserts, and drinks)

While you're writing out your JSON, it might help to periodically paste your JSON into [JSONlint](http://jsonlint.com/) to validate that the syntax is correct.
