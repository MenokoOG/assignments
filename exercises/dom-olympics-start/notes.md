You will use it to work your way through the Olympic medals.

Follow the instructions in the README.

You will complete the requirements of this assignment using JavaScript only.

This is a simple messaging app. Your job is to make it interactive.

Feel free to change the CSS not mentioned in the assignment if you feel so inclined.

### Bronze

Your first task is to use pure JavaScript to insert a header to the top of this page. It should look like this:

The HTML for the header's container exists but the header and the name don't exist yet.

Feel free to change `.style` or use `.name` or `.header` classes from the CSS file.

Notice that your name needs to be a different color. Wrapping text in a `span` tag is a great way to do this.

### Silver

There's some sub par conversation going on in this messaging app. You have two tasks to help give it either a clean slate, or a positive start.

- Write some custom JavaScript to automatically change the words of the conversation to something fun and good.
- Write some JavaScript that will wait until the user clicks the "clear" button, and then clears out all conversation.

### Gold

Themes!

- Use the drop down to write some JavaScript that will notice when the drop down has changed and then changes the background colors of the messages accordingly.
