## Project Requirements ( 32 Total Story Points )

### Proposal ( 8 Story Points: Record Story Point 384.75 )

This part of the project is to help you narrow down your idea, clarify its parts and make it easier to start coding.

The requirements are as follows.

- Paragraph describing your app idea, What are you building? Who is it for?
- An easily describableÂ [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), Remember you have a limited amount of time to develop this project. What is the minimum you can get done on this project to meet the requirements and get a product in someone's hand?
- [User Story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories), What is a user going to do when they go to your site from the time they hit the landing page? What features do they need and which are optional?
- [Mind Map](https://www.mindmup.com/), What is the structure of your backend and front app going to look like? What routes, models, components, actions, and reducers will I need?

Once you have these items, you need to post the proposal in the Level 5 channel and an instructor will give you the go ahead!

Brush up on how to write user stories and have fun!

You are tasked with building a full-stack application, meaning you will need to build the API, server, and front-end React app. Here are the requirements:

### Backend: ( 16 Story Points : Record Story Point 400.75 )

- Must use express, mongoose and morgan dependencies.
- Must create your own API. (3rd party APIs can be used as well in addition to your own).
- You must create at least one mongoose model to store in a mongodb database.

### Frontend: ( 8 Story Points : Record Story Point 408.75 )

- Must use create-react-app, axios and react-router-dom dependencies
- Must have at least 3 routes (pages/views)
- Must include as many as the CRUD methods as your app needs. (at least 2 would be great, which would include doing a Get All and a Get One for example).
- Use Tools and techniques such as React Context, custom hooks, HOC's or Render Props to practice keeping your code DRY and reusable.

### **Passing criteria: Project demo to the Instructor**
